            <h1>REFUND AND CANCELLATION POLICY</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="last-updated">
            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 6, 2025
        </div>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>
                Thank you for choosing <strong>City Expert Care</strong>. We strive to ensure that you have the best
                experience with our Service Professionals. However, we understand that plans change or things may not go
                as expected. This Refund and Cancellation Policy explains how we handle bookings that are cancelled or
                services that do not meet your expectations.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. CANCELLATION BY THE CUSTOMER</h2>
        <p>
            You can cancel your booking through the City Expert Care Platform at any time. However, to compensate our
            Service Professionals for their time and travel, cancellation fees may apply depending on when you cancel:
        </p>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <strong>(a) Free Cancellation:</strong> You may cancel your booking for free up to <strong>2 hours</strong>
            before the scheduled slot.
        </div>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <strong>(b) Late Cancellation Fee:</strong> If you cancel within <strong>2 hours</strong> of the scheduled
            slot, a cancellation fee of <strong>INR 100</strong> may be charged to compensate the Service Professional.
        </div>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <strong>(c) Doorstep Cancellation:</strong> If you cancel after the Service Professional has arrived at your
            location, or if the professional is unable to start the service due to your unavailability or lack of
            access, a "Doorstep Cancellation Fee" of <strong>INR 200</strong> will apply.
        </div>

        <h2>2. CANCELLATION BY CITY CARE OR SERVICE PROFESSIONAL</h2>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <strong>(a)</strong> In the unlikely event that a Service Professional cancels your booking or does not show
            up, we will attempt to find a replacement immediately.
        </div>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <strong>(b)</strong> If we cannot provide a replacement, or if you choose not to opt for a replacement, no
            cancellation fee will be charged.
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>(c)</strong> If you have made an advance payment online, the full amount will be refunded to your
            original source of payment.
        </div>

        <h2>3. REFUNDS FOR SERVICE DISSATISFACTION</h2>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <strong>(b) Resolution:</strong> Our team will investigate the complaint. Depending on the nature of the
            issue, we may offer:
            <ul>
                <li>A re-service (re-work) of the specific task at no extra cost.</li>
                <li>City Expert Care Credits to your wallet for future use.</li>
                <li>A partial or full monetary refund.</li>

            City Expert Care, based on the evidence provided (e.g., photos of the work) and the specific circumstances.
        </div>

        <h2>4. PROCESSING OF REFUNDS</h2>

        <div class="policy-item">

            Debit Card, UPI, etc.). If you paid via City Expert Care Credits, the refund will be credited back to your
            City Expert Care wallet.
        </div>

        <div class="policy-item">
            <strong>(c) Bank Delays:</strong> Please note that while we initiate the refund instantly, your bank may
