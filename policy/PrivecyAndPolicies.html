        <p><strong>(b)</strong> Where you have chosen a password that enables you to access certain parts of the
            Services or Professional Services, you are responsible for keeping this password secret and confidential. We
            will not be responsible for any unauthorised use of your information, or for any lost, stolen, or
            compromised passwords, or for any activity on your user account due to such unauthorised disclosure of your
            password. In the event your password has been compromised in any manner whatsoever, you should promptly
            notify us to enable us to initiate a change of password.</p>

            and obligations.</p>

        <p><strong>(b)</strong> In some circumstances, we may aggregate your personal data (so that it can no longer be
