                Expert Care website and/or the City Expert Care mobile app (collectively, the "Platform", and together
                with the services made available on or through the Platform, the "Services"). These Terms also include
                our privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"), and any guidelines, additional, or supplemental terms, policies,
                and disclaimers made available or issued by us from time to time ("Supplemental Terms"). The Privacy
                Policy and the Supplemental Terms form an integral part of these Terms. In the event of a conflict
                between these Terms and the Supplemental Terms with respect to applicable Services, the Supplemental
                Terms will prevail.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Terms constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between City Expert Care ("City Expert
                Care", "we", "us", or "our"), and you, a user of the Services, or any legal entity that books Pro
                Services (defined below) on behalf of end-users ("you" or "Customer"). By using the Services, you
                represent and warrant that you have full legal capacity and authority to agree to and bind yourself to
                these Terms. If you represent any other person, you confirm and represent that you have the necessary
                power and authority to bind such person to these Terms.

            <p>
                <strong>By using the Services, you agree that you have read, understood, and are bound by, these Terms,
                    as amended from time to time, and that you will comply with the requirements listed here. These
                    Terms expressly supersede any prior written agreements with you. If you do not agree to these Terms,
                    or comply with the requirements listed here, please do not use the Services.</strong>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. SERVICES</h2>

        <p><strong>(a)</strong> The Services include the provision of the Platform that enables you to arrange and
            schedule different home-based services with independent third-party service providers of those services
            ("Service Professionals"). As a part of the Services, City Expert Care facilitates the transfer of payments
            to Service Professionals for the services they render to you and collects payments on behalf of such Service
            Professionals.</p>

        <p><strong>(b)</strong> The services rendered by Service Professionals are referred to as "Pro Services". The
            term "Services" does not include the Pro Services. City Expert Care does not provide the Pro Services and is
            not responsible for their provision. Service Professionals are solely liable and responsible for the Pro
            Services that they offer or otherwise provide through the Platform. City Expert Care and its affiliates do
            not employ Service Professionals, nor are Service Professionals agents, contractors, or partners of City
            Expert Care or its affiliates. Service Professionals do not have the ability to bind or represent City
            Expert Care.</p>

        <p><strong>(c)</strong> The Platform is for your personal and non-commercial use only, unless otherwise agreed
            upon in accordance with the terms of a separate agreement. Please note that the Platform is intended for use
            only within India. You agree that in the event you avail the Services or Pro Services from a legal
            jurisdiction other than the territory of India, you will be deemed to have accepted the City Expert Care
            terms and conditions applicable to that jurisdiction.</p>

        <p><strong>(d)</strong> The Services are made available under various brands owned by or otherwise licensed to
            City Expert Care and its affiliates.</p>

        <p><strong>(e)</strong> A key part of the Services is City Expert Care's ability to send you text messages,
            electronic mails, or WhatsApp messages, including in connection with your bookings, your utilisation of the
            Services, or as a part of its promotional and marketing strategies. While you may opt out of receiving these
            text messages by contacting City Expert Care at support@cityexpertcare.com or through the in-Platform
            settings, you agree and acknowledge that this may impact City Expert Care's ability to provide the Services
            (or a part of the Services) to you.</p>

        <p><strong>(f)</strong> In certain instances, you may be required to furnish identification proof to avail the
            Services or the Pro Services, and hereby agree to do so. A failure to comply with this request may result in
            your inability to use the Services or Pro Services.</p>

            <li><strong>(ii)</strong> You agree that (i) you shall use City Expert Care Credits in a lawful manner, and

                disabled by City Expert Care at any time for any reason without any liability to you, (iv) City Expert
                Care Credits are not valid for cash, and (v) City Expert Care Credits may expire prior to your use.</li>
            <li><strong>(iii)</strong> City Expert Care may, at its sole discretion, provide only certain users with

            <li><strong>(iv)</strong> City Expert Care reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other

        <h2>6. PRICING, FEES, AND PAYMENT TERMS</h2>

        <p><strong>(a)</strong> City Expert Care reserves the right to charge you for the different Services you may

                be required to pay Service Professionals the amount indicated at the time of booking as well as amounts
                towards (a) any additional Pro Services you may avail, (b) out of pocket expenses incurred by the
                Service Professional, and (c) expenses arising out of the purchase of goods required or utilised for the
                performance of the Pro Service ("Charges"). In addition to the Charges payable to Service Professionals,

                that the final bill you receive may include additional charges, including without limitation, a safety
                fee, warranty fee, insurance fee, or Service Professional welfare fee.</li>
            <li><strong>(ii)</strong> City Expert Care shall notify you of the applicable Charges, Fees, and payment

                modify and otherwise restrict the modes of payment available to you. You acknowledge that certain
                payment methods such as cash upon completion may not always be available to you as a payment method. For
                the avoidance of doubt, in the event you pay through the method of 'cash upon completion', you
                acknowledge that you will be required to pay both Charges and Fees to the Service Professional.</li>
            <li><strong>(iii)</strong> The Charges and Fees may be payable at the time of making a booking, or upon the

            <li><strong>(v) Taxes:</strong> All Charges and Fees are inclusive of applicable taxes.</li>
            <li><strong>(vi)</strong> City Expert Care reserves the right to reasonably amend the Charges and Fees at
                any time at its sole discretion. A change in Fees shall not impact any bookings that have been confirmed
                before the publication of the revised Fees on the Platform.</li>
            <li><strong>(vii)</strong> Charges and Fees that you pay are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise
                determined by City Expert Care or required by the applicable laws. Under certain laws, you may be
                entitled to a refund or other remedies for a failure in the provision of the Services.</li>
            <li><strong>(viii)</strong> You acknowledge and agree that Charges and Fees applicable in certain
                geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. City Expert Care will use
                reasonable efforts to inform you of the Charges and Fees that may apply. However, by using the Pro
                Services or Services, you will be responsible for the Charges and Fees incurred under your Account
                regardless of your awareness of such Charges or Fees.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>(c) Payment Processors:</strong> We may use a third-party payment processor ("Payment Processor") to
            bill you through your selected mode of payment. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms and
            policies of such Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. We shall not be liable for any error of the
            Payment Processor. In the event of any unsuccessful payment, the money debited shall be credited in
            accordance with the terms of the Payment Processor.</p>

        <p><strong>(d) Cancellation:</strong> You may elect to cancel your request for services from a Service
            Professional at any time prior to such Service Professional's arrival, in which case you may be charged a
            cancellation fee in accordance with City Expert Care's cancellation policy. City Expert Care reserves the
            right to charge you, or otherwise deduct applicable taxes in respect of such cancellation fee.</p>

        <p><strong>(e) Subscriptions:</strong> City Expert Care may from time to time offer subscription packages
            (howsoever named) for monetary consideration. The packages shall provide Customers with additional benefits,
            which may include the ability to avail discounted Pro Services. You agree that subscription packages
            (howsoever named) shall be subject to additional terms and conditions. You acknowledge that such
            subscription packages will be subject to additional terms and conditions that will be deemed to be an
            integral part of these Terms.</p>

        <p><strong>(f)</strong> City Expert Care does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to
            the Service Professional. Any representation by City Expert Care to the effect that tipping is "voluntary",
            "not required", and/or "included" in the payments you make for Pro Services is not intended to suggest that
            City Expert Care provides any additional payments to Service Professionals. You understand and agree that
            while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Service Professional who provides you
            with Pro Services, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary.</p>

        <h2>7. CUSTOMER CONDUCT</h2>

        <p><strong>(a)</strong> City Expert Care prohibits discrimination against Service Professionals, including on
            the basis of race, religion, caste, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, sex, marital status,
            gender identity, age, or any other characteristic that may be protected under applicable law. Such
            discrimination includes but is not limited to any refusal to accept Pro Services based on any of these
            characteristics.</p>

        <p><strong>(b)</strong> We request that you treat all Service Professionals with courtesy and respect, and that
            you provide them with a safe, clean, and appropriate location to perform the Pro Services. Service
            Professionals shall be entitled to refuse to perform Pro Services if you have not provided a safe, clean,
            and appropriate location for them, or you behave towards them in a manner which is discourteous,
            disrespectful, abusive, or otherwise inappropriate. We reserve the right to withhold access to the Services
            and otherwise limit your access to Pro Services at our absolute discretion if you behave towards any Service
            Professional in a manner which is discourteous, disrespectful, or abusive, or which we otherwise deem to be
            inappropriate or unlawful.</p>

        <p><strong>(c)</strong> You agree that you will be liable for discriminating against Service Professionals or
            for any failure, intentional or otherwise, to provide the Service Professionals a safe, clean, and
            appropriate location for them to perform the Pro Services. Additionally, you will also disclose any and all
            information that may have a bearing on the ability of the Service Professional to perform the Pro Services
            or impact the Services Professional's health, safety, or well-being, to City Expert Care and the Service
            Professional.</p>

        <p><strong>(d)</strong> You agree that in the event a Service Professional behaves in a manner that is
            discourteous, disrespectful, abusive, inappropriate, or in violation of the law, you shall be required to
            report such incident to grievance@cityexpertcare.com at the earliest but in any event within 48 (forty
            eight) hours of such incident.</p>
